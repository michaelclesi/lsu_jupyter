  This application launches Jupyter Lab using the vanilla Python 3.9.7 module. 
        
  Once Jupyter starts, users will be able to choose their Python kernels from a number of options:

    - **System modules** - vanilla Python environments installed by HPC staff
    - **Containers** - container-based Python environments built by HPC staff
    - **Conda VE** - Conda Virtual Environments installed by user
        
  To ensure that a Conda VE appears as a Jupyter kernel, users must have the ipykernel package installed in it. After activating your conda VE, run:
  
  ```python
  conda install ipykernel
  ```

  This only needs to be run once.
